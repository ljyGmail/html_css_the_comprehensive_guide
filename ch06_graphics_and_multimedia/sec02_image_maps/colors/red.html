    <h1>You have chosen red</h1>
    <p>Red is the color of fire.</p>
    <p>
      In a good mood, you radiate energy and vitality today and thus attract
      attention. A good day for a new love or the beginning of a new passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are in a bad mood, you are likely to become aggressive and angry
      quite quickly. Try to control your temper somehow so as not to hurt
      anyone.
