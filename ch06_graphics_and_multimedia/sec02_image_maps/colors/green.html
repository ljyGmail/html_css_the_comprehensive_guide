      When you are in a good mood, you have a calming effect on other people.
      You convey security, harmony and hope. Use this mood to start something
      new in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should be careful, however, if you are in a bad mood, as you can
      easily become envious of other people. If you seem indifferent to
      everything and nothing is going on in you life, you are probably overtired
      and should think about taking a longer break.
