    <h1>You have selected cyan</h1>
    <p>
      The color cyan (also called turquoise) is a refreshing color. It is the
      color of waters and beautiful sunny days.

      If you are in a good mood, you are probably well-rested and lucid. Use
      this mental openness and freedom to give free rein to your creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have chosen the color in a bad mood, you should avoid people who
      are close to you, because this color color also stands for coldness and
      distance and thus you would only convey a feeling of emptiness.
